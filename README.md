# RedditBot

### Bot that replies to comments with any quirky joke, a weird Kanye West Quote, the summary of a wikipedia article of anything, fetches the youtube link of any song or video!

#### To Run:

      1. Clone this repo
      2. Change Username, Password, Client ID and Client Secret in config.py as needed and subreddit in functions.py
      3. Run bot.py
      4. Comment in any recent post in the given subreddit (by default r/test) with:
            * !joke
            * !kanye
            * !wiki ARTICLE_NAME
            * !find VIDEO_NAME

Completed Project.
